<p>TickTock10 in a simple basic explanation is a competitive addicting and fun way to get all brand new like a new iPad and it is $600. You have five options to pick a 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 player game. Depending on the choice, you can pay either half which gives you a 50% chance of winning, or a 4 player game which is a quarter of the cost and gives you a 25% chance of winning. You start the trivia challenge with an 11 question game in the category of your choice and have 10 seconds to answer the fastest and the most correctly per question. Each second counts and the clock is ticking. Answer in one second gets the balance of nine seconds on your score. Answer in three seconds gets seven seconds on your score. Only correct answers to get the point score. Whoever has the most points at the end of 11 games is the winner and buys the item at a fraction of the cost.</p>
